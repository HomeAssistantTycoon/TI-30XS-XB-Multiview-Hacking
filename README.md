 <summary>Our Goal</summary>
  Our Goal is simple: To achive arbitrary code execution (ACE) on the TI30XS/XB Multiview. This will allow the user to run their own code on the calculator. There are many steps on the road to ACE, generally involving a series of glitches. The most important part is understanding how the calculator’s memory and pointers behave when glitches occur, since that’s the key to turning harmless bugs into real control.
 <summary>Progress</summary>
 Currently, we've discovered a buffer overflow glitch with the help of [ndeineko](https://github.com/ndeineko), which can be utilized to display and use calculator functions not accessible under normal operation, such as lcm and gcd.
